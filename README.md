# Sentiment-Analysis
Using tensorflow and keras I created a sentiment weight file to use snetiment analysis in the future.

# Requirements
Tesnorflow, Keras

# How it works ? 

Firstly we need to extensive dataset to train this model I used Headlines Datasets from https://rishabhmisra.github.io/publications/ .
Convert datasets to list elements and tokenize them. After that fit text to sequences and pad them.
We have to split list elements to train model.
When we split to elemnts we are ready to train the model but we also need a neaural network, it's simply and useful.
When you take a look at codes you can understand easily, I explained codes. I hope you can benefit.
